        <h4>October 7, 2021</h4>
        <h4>By: Lucy Cabrera</h4>
  
    <p>On September 19, Mayor Bill de Blasio, along with BlocPower, announced a $37 million employment program 
        to keep the most vulnerable youth away from gun violence. This program awards them a certificate in 
        various green energy technologies, and they will be eligible for high demand jobs that will pay well.</p>
    <p>The initiative seeks to create 1,500 jobs in the city's poorest neighborhoods: South Jamaica, East and 
        Central Harlem, Mott Heaven, the Bronx, and Brownsville in Brooklyn, which have been the hardest hit 
        by gun violence.</p>
    <p>According to a New York Times report, there were considerably fewer shootings in June and July than in 
        the same months of 2020. But there is optimism that everything will improve as the number of victims 
        last year was higher than in 2021.</p>
    <p>According to a survey carried out by CCI, with 330 young people from neighborhoods with a high rate of 
        gun violence, 87% have carried or had a weapon. The survey was conducted among 330 young people aged 
        16-24 years, 79% were Latino and African American.
        The study found that those who carry weapons have experienced violence or are suspicious of the police. 
        According to the survey, almost nine out of 10 participants said they belonged to a gang and believe 
        that their gangs provide this "protection."</p>
